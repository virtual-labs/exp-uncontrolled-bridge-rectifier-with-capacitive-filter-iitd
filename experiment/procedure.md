### Procedure

a)  Circuit formulation:
<br>
Click-on the diode to place them correctly in the circuit.

I.  Incorrect direction of diode: It becomes RED.
II.  Repeat these steps to complete the diode bridge circuit.

b)  Principle of operation of the bridge rectifier: Diode bridge circuit operates in two modes as given below: 
<br>

I.  In positive half cycle, the diodes ‘D<sub>1</sub>’ and ‘D<sub>2</sub>’ are conducting while the diodes: D<sub>3</sub>, D<sub>4</sub> are in blocking state.
II.  Similarly, for negative half cycle ‘D<sub>3</sub>’ and ‘D<sub>4</sub>’ are conducting while the diodes ‘D<sub>1</sub>’ and ‘D<sub>2</sub>’ are in blocking state.
<br>

c)  Performance analysis of the circuit: 
<br>

I.  Keeping constant “Load Resistance (R)” vary the “Source Voltage (vac)” in steps.<br>
II. Press “RECORD” button to fill the table of observations.<br>
III. To observe various performance characteristics, select the parameter “icons” and then press “PLOT” icon.<br> 
IV. Repeat the above steps to observe various other performance characteristics.<br>
V.  Follow similar steps even for “Diode bridge rectifier with C-filter” and compare the performance characteristics.<br>
