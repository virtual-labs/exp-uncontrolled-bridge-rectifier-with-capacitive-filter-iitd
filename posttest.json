      "question": "What is the purpose of filter at the output side of diode bridge rectifier?",
      "answers": {  
        "a": "It reduces the ripple content in the output voltage only and decreases dc-load power.",
        "b": "It reduces the ripple content in the output voltage, output current and increases the dc-load power.",
        "c": "There will be no change in any of the parameters.",
        "d": "The ripple content in the output dc-load voltage increases."
